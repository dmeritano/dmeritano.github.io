            Work Experience
          </p>          
          <p class="mt-3 fs-6 ps-3">
            I developed my professional career in a small technology company (60 people on average) where I was able to grow and play different roles, sometimes exclusively and others dividing my time between my functions.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            I have worked on hundreds of projects (many of them challenging) for large clients in the banking/finance sector.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            I started as Application Support L1, L2, L3 and QA Tester.
          </p>          
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            Later, I was promoted to Head of Support and QA/Testing, with various people in charge.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            I performed System Administration tasks (Netware &#128532;, Windows, Linux), such as installation and configuration of network services like DNS, Active Directory, Email Server, FTP, DHCP, Firewall(iptables), Proxy Servers, Load Balancer (Nginx). Web Servers (Apache, IIS). DBMS like Oracle, SQL Server, Actian (Btrieve), MongoDB, etc. App Servers like Websphere, Tomcat ..)
          </p>          
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            In 2003, programming stopped being a hobby for me, since I started to perform application maintenance (corrective/evolutionary/preventive). The tools were C, C++ and VB.
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            I worked part time on dozens of projects as Technical & Functional Analyst for clients in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Puerto Rico and Mexico
          </p>
          <p class="fs-6 ps-3">
            In 2010 I was promoted to Head of PM, Development, and QA teams, reaching 25 people in charge (cross country/latam) of different specialties and seniorities (functional analysts, programmers, testers, project managers). As a team and tech lead, my goals point to build trust in all directions by promoting constant communication between group members, guiding them technically when it's necessary, and to give emotional support in the critical moments of the projects (a key piece!).
            <strong>This stage </strong>allowed me to dedicate more time to software development. The following are the technologies I have worked with and, mostly, the ones I still work with:
